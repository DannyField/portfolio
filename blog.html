    <h2>Sink or Swim</h2>
    <h4>28th March 2020</h4>
    <p>
      When I started creating this webpage I was a little unsure. Still as I write my first post I am still unsure. "Unsure of what?" you might say. Unsure of lots of things in fact. Except for wanting to make this work. I have a desire to become a Full-stack developer at the end of the course, but at times I do feel like I'm floating. Sometimes the waves go over my head, and sometimes I'm swimming with confidence.<br><br>The odd thing is that I can't swim. Not in the real sense of swimming anyway.

    <h2>My birthday</h2>
    <h4>23rd March 2020</h4>
    <p>
      It was an interesting day to say the least. I had forgotten that it was my birthday. It was also the first day that we had our first online course for Coder Academy. Some of us were ok with it. At least give it a try. But I fear for those days where we would like Harrison or Ed to look over our code. Before, we could sheepishly call them over and get some ideas. But online, it makes it hard. I guess we'll see how we go. I can't wait to go back though. Even though the 1 hour train ride was a pain, at least it kinda felt like work.

    <h2>A project too big</h2>
    <h4>13th March 2020</h4>
    <p>
      I set out to create an adventure game that was a little too full on. Like, it's an idea that is possible.. but not in 2 days of coding. In fact, I don't know why I choose that. I had originally another idea that would have helped my work by grabbing data from the BOM. gov website and throw the data into a CSV file. Then open up photoshop and import the figure as I normally do. But this adventure game inspired me and while I got a couple of stories done, I knew that it wouldn't be finished at the end of 2 days.

    <h2>A change of pace</h2>
    <h4>10th March 2020</h4>
    <p>
      Maybe not so much as a change in pace, but a change of scenery. While still a cinematographer, I've decided to try my hand at being a full stack developer. Ideally, with a chance to get a full time job and none of this horrible freelance business. I actually look forward to the day where I'll take the train ride into the city, settle into my office and figure out solutions to coding issues. Hopefully this will see me out till retirement.

    <h2>Crack the locks</h2>
    <h4>22nd February 2020</h4>
    <p>
     Prior to starting at Coder Academy, I've been interested in pentesting and the areas of ethical hacking. With my version of Kali linux on a spare USB and my tp link wi-fi modem, I set out to crack local wi-fi..... Well in an ethical kind of way. My own. Of course, that led into a rabbit hole of cool hacking apps, linux commands and even some pentesting businesses in the US that are actually paid to break into company buildings to hack their way in.
